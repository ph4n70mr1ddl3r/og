Notes:  
Anyone can pay the gas and execute the claim but the OG tokens will always go to the genesis holders.  
A few test claims will be executed.  
All the data needed to claim is already calculated and stored in proofs.txt just pass the data in the claim function of the contract.  

Sample claim using etherscan write contract:
